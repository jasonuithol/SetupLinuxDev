This computer appears to be using the Nvidia binary graphics driver (the nvidia-driver package).

Steam is a 32-bit program, so running it on this computer requires the 32-bit versions of the Nvidia libraries, even if all the games you will run via Steam are 64-bit. Please install the nvidia-driver-libs:i386 package.

For full functionality (including Vulkan), also install the libraries listed as Recommends in the nvidia-driver-libs:i386 package.

If you are using a legacy version of the Nvidia driver such as nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver, please install the corresponding 32-bit legacy package, for example nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver-libs:i386.
